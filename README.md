# 🌱 flask-Vue3-LiteAI：DBNet + SVTR | 算法部署平台 🌱
- For the algorithm level, I adopted the algorithm combination of DBNet (text detection) + SVTR (text recognition) to realize the "Universal OCR System" and "License Plate Location and Recognition System" respectively. <br>
- For the platform level, I adopt the application development combination mode of Flask + Vue3 to serve as the functional container for the deployment of various algorithms.<br>
- For the container level, in the front-end Vue3, I added the "login and exit", "user information management" and other functions; Flask at the back end, I adopted a Mysql database to store user information (including tokens).<br>

☂️ The "user management" function of the project, which I will not show here, stores the information of super administrator and ordinary users, which can be added and deleted.<br>

In order to let the little friends experience the effect of the algorithm deployment platform, I chose Tencent cloud server to deploy their own algorithm platform. Here I mainly by judging the user name and identity, to display the corresponding page to different users. At present, I have deployed my algorithm platform to Tencent Cloud server (cheaper, and sometimes slow response), the website is: www.wqbvegeai.xyz. Welcome friends to play (do not register oh ~).<br>

**☆ Here is a video demonstration of my deployment on Tencent Cloud server**
